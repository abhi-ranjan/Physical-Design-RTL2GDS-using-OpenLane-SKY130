# Physical-Design-RTL2GDS-using-OpenLane-SKY130
The following repository consists of knowledge gained and steps followed while doing the Advanced Physical Design Using [OpenLANE/SKY130](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) workshop. The [workshop](https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/advanced-physical-design-using-openlane-sky130/) focuses on the complete ASIC flow approach from RTL2GDS using open soucrce EDA tools such as OpenLANE/SKY130. RISC-V architechture is followed for designing the the core of [PICORV32A](https://github.com/YosysHQ/picorv32).
