# About RTL to GDSII Flow
RTL (Register tranfer level) to GDSII (Graphic Data Stream) flow consists of the complete set of steps required to create a file which could be sent for tapeout. The RTL code is synthesized and optimised. After sysnthesis of the code, PnR, floor and power planning is done while keeping in check the timing constraints. At the end GDSII file is written out.
The complete flow consists of following steps:
* Writting RTL
* Synthesis
* STA (Static Timing Analysis)
* DFT (Design for Testability) 
* Floorplanning
* Placement
* CTS (Clock Tree Synthesis)
* Routing
* GDSII Streaming

# SKYWater130 PDK

  ## How to talk to computers
  ### IC Terminologies
  In the complete flow to this RTL2GDS physical designing there are lot of terminologies one comes across. Some of these terms are described below.
  * Package - ICs are basically presents as packages. These packages are materials which contains the semiconductor device. These packages protect the device from damage. these are of various kind. An example of QFN-48 (Quad Falt No-Leads) with 48 pins is taken here.
  
  ![package](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214497117-07e825ff-26dc-4a42-ac74-d103bdcaa6d5.png)

  * Chip - It sits in the centre of the package. The chip is connected to the package pins using **wire bond**. Inside the chip we have various components such as pad, core, interconnects, etc.
  * Pads - These are the itermediate structure through which the internal signals from the core of IC is connected to the external pins of the chip. These pads are organised as Pad Frame. There are different kind of pads for input, output, power supply and ground.
  * Core - It is the place where all the logic units (gates, muxs, etc) are presnet inside the chip. These are able to execute the set of instructions given to the chip and produce an output.
  * Die - It is the block which consists of semiconducting material and it can be used to build certain functional cuircuit which can be further sent for fabrication. It is the entire size of the chip.
  ![Die](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214504383-203376f6-4efe-40f3-a713-644c64ed1bbc.png)

  ### Introduction to RISC-V
  **[RISC-V](https://riscv.org/technical/specifications/)** is an open instruction set architechture rooted on **reduced instruction set computer principles**. It is an open source ISA used for processor design. 
  #### RISC-V Characterstics
  * It uses one clock cycle per instruction.
  * It follows the th RISC Princples. 
  * It has both 32-bit and 64-bit varients. It also support floating point instruction.
  * It avoids micro-architechture or technology dependent features.
  * It accelerates the time for design to reach the market as it uses open-source IP.
  
  ### Software to Hardware 
  The flow shows how the high level language (at software end) gets converted to machine language (at hardware end) and then gets executed on the package.
  #### What happens when we run a program?
  Suppose a C program needs to run on a hardware. So we nned to pass this C program to the hardware. So firstly the C program is compiled into assembly language (RISC-V assembly language program). Now this assmebly language is converted into the machine language program (basically 1's and 0's). Now this 1's and 0's are understanable by the hardware.

#### How does an application run on a computer?
1. The application software enters the system software (major component of it are OS, Compiler and Assembler). 
 * The OS handles I/O operations, memories and many low level functions.
 * then the program passes to Compiler which changes the program to Assembly language (compiled into instructions depends upon the hardware).
 * Now the instruction set goes to Assembler. Assembler converts the instruction set to machine language (binary numbers). 
2. The system software converts the apllication software into binary language. 
3. Now these binary numbers enter our chip layout and according the function is performed.

## SoC design and OpenLane
### Introduction to Digital design
For designing Digital ASIC ICs we require following components and some of it's opensource resources are also mentioned. 
 * RTL models (old IP's) {github.com, librecores.org, etc}
 * EDA tool {OpenROAD, OpenLANE, etc}
 * PDK Data {SKYWater 130} 
 
 In the workshop every component is used from sources which are open soucre. The following image gives an idea about each component as an open source resource. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214576102-b48d6010-44a6-466a-b9cb-62adcb012c5e.png)

 
#### What is a PDK? 
PDK stands for Process Design Kit, it is provided by foundaries and it consists of library or set of building blocks which are used to build ICs. Each component in the library is seperate building bolck and ae made following certain foundary rules.

PDKs acts as an inteface between the FABs and the designeers. PDKs have collection of files whcih are used to model a fabrication process for the EDA tools used to design an IC. PDK consists of tecnology node information, Process Design Rules (to verify DRC, LVC, PEX, etc), device model, I/O libraries, Standard cell libraries, macros files, lef files, etc.

**Google along with SKYWater made the laters PDK opensource (130 nm node).** The PDK only need data information for successful implementation.

#### Environment Setup
The OpenLANE flow requires various open source tools as well as their supporting tools to be installed for the complete Physical design flow. Installing this tools one by one is tedious as well as one can get lost in the steps. Installation can be done easily using some set of scripts present in following repositories [VSDFlow](https://github.com/kunalg123/vsdflow) (for installing Yosys, OpenSTA, Magic, OpenTimer, netgent, etc)  and [OpenLANE Build Scripts](https://github.com/nickson-jose/openlane_build_script).

### Simplified RTL to GDSII Flow
   
![gnome-shell-screenshot-6miv9a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214678043-5d9b90e2-e05b-42a4-a893-5ab572dd1ff0.png)

   The flow starts from the HDL code i.e.RTL model and ends with GDSII file. The major implimenation steps are:
   * Synthesis - During synthesis the HDL design is translated into circuits,  which are made up of components present in the standard cell library. The resultant circuit is described in HDL and its referred as gate level netlist which is functional equivalent of RTL code. The library building block of cell have regular layouts, cell layout is enclosed by fixed height (rectanglar in shape) whereas the width is variable an is discrete i.e., integer multiple of unit call side width.
                       
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214678337-67f65f23-30e9-499d-b5d2-bcdb35758077.png)
   
   * Floor Planning - In Floor planning the chip area is being planned which in turn creates a robust Power distribution to power the circuits. The die is partitioned into different building blocks or components, also the I?O pads are distributed. During macro floor planning macro dimensions, it's pin locations and row definations i.e, rows and routing plan.
  
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214678571-dbe1e73e-d3cb-4d71-87d3-74a53e9a503b.png)
   
   * Power Planning - The power network is constructed typically for a chip was it has to power multiple VDD and ground pins. The power pin are connected to all component through rings and multiple horizontal and vertical strips. Sach parallel structure is meant to reduce the resistance.
  
![gnome-shell-screenshot-12eny2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214678807-208f9984-65ac-4df7-af16-a0399e19ee49.png)

   * Placements - For macros we place the GATE level netlist cell on vertical rows. To reduce the interconnect delay conical cells are placed very close to each other and this is also done to enable successful routing afterwards. Placement is done in two ways Global placement and detailed placement. Global placement provide optimal result and these may or may not be legal where as the detail placement is always legal.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214679067-e04bca1c-a4dd-4099-9feb-ab1cb5b1743f.png)

   * Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) - Before signal routing clock routing is done so that the clock distribution is done to every sequential block. Clock distribution network delivers the clock to each of the sequential block. It is done so that there is minimum skew and latency. It usually follows a shape i.e., H-tree, X-tree, etc.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214679269-79bb1c1f-2f82-4857-9248-1f55c18ec41c.png)

   * Routing - The signal routing is done using metal layers. It is essential to find valid pattern of horizontal and verticle wires to implement the nets that connects the cells together. Router uses the available metal layers as defined by the PDK. For each metal layer the PDK defines the thickness, width, pitch and vias. Vias are used to connect two metal wires. SkyWater 130nm has 6 metal layers.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214679422-b3ec0d10-5a54-4203-b5b8-705d5245b8a2.png)

   * Verification and Sign-offs - After PnR and CTS we perform verifications, to check whether our layout is valid or not. These verifications consists of Physical verification such as DRC and LVS. Design Rules Checking (DRC) ensures that the layout follows the design rules and Layout Vs Schematic ensures that the final layout is as per the synthesised gate level netlist or not. Finally Static Timing Analysis is done (STA) to make sure that all the timing constraints are met by the circuit.
   
### About OpenLANE
[OpenLANE](https://openlane.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a flow which uses various open source tools for the RTL to GDSII flow. It has the striVe family of open everything SoCs (Open PDK, Open EDA, Open RTL). The various tools it uses are Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, Netgen, SPEF_Extraction, etc.  

* It has two mode of Operations: Autonomus and Interactive
* It is tuned for SKYWater 130nm open PDK.
* OpenLANE ASIC flow is shown below. 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214687083-4fadeba1-1a31-4794-9c83-13f924430f3e.png)

* The flow starts with RTL Synthesis. RTL is fed to Yosys with the design constraints. Yosys translates the RTL into a logic circuit using generic components. 
* the circuit can be optimized and then mapped with standard cell library usin the tool abc. There are [abc scrript](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/) to guide the optimization. OpenLANE has several abc scripts which has different synthesis statergies (least area, least power consumption, etc). The synthesis exploration utility is for statergy exploration and report generation.
* OpenLANE has design exploration utility which can be used to sweep the design configurations (16 in total) and it genrates reports which has different design matrix and also shows the number of violations in layout. It is used for regression testing and to find the best configuration of our design. 
* OpenSTA performs the Static timing analysis on the netlist which is generated during synthesis.
* Now after synthesis, the testing part starts (DFT) i.e., scan insertion, Automatic Test Pattern Generation (ATPG), Test Pattern Compaction, Fault Coverage and Fault Simulation. This step is optional.
* Nest step is Physical implementation. This part is done with the help of OpenROAD application. It performs PnR which consists of FP+PP, Placement (Global and Detailed), Optimization, CTS and routing (Global and Detailed). TritonRoute is used for detailed routing.
* Logic equivalence checking (LEC) is performed as the circuit changes due to optimization process as compare to the one generated during synthesis. This is done using Yosys tool to make sure the functionality is equivalent. 
* During insertion there is a special step that is fake antenna insertion. It is required to address the antenna rule violations. The concept of fake antenna is something like we have already considered the antenna so that on later stage we do not have any antenna violations. Hence we add fake antenna diode next to every cell input after placement. Then antenna checker is run from the Magic tool against the layout. 
* Fake antenna diode cell is created and added to standard cell library. 

/*hence a long wire is simulated it acts as an antenna but as a conductor it collects charges which can damage the transistor gates connected to the wire during fab. So the length of wire connected to transistor gate must be limited. This is done by the help of Router.*/

* The sign off include STA, DRC and LVS. It also involves interconnect RC extraxtion from the routed layout followed by STA using OpenSTA.
* Physical signoffs include DRC and LVS. DRC and LVS is performed using Magic tool. Circuit extraction is done NetGen.

## Getting familier to open-source EDA tools

* skywater pdk consists of skywater 130 nm pdks.

**NOTE:** - Here **sky130_fd_sc_hd libs.tech** is being used.
4. config files - It bypasses any configuration that has already been done i.e., many of the switches use default value that is already present in the OpenLane flow.
**The precedence order of Openlane settings are:**
* sky130_xyz_config.tcl
* config.tcl
* Default value (already set in OpenLane)

### LAB Day 1

# Day 2 - Good floorplan vs bad floorplan and introduction to library cells

## Chip Floor planning
Here we try to come up with the width and height of the chip.

### Utilization factor and aspect ratio

1. Determining width and height of the core and die
 While defining the dimensions of the chip we are mostly dependent on the dimensions of the logic gates (standard cells) sitting in the netlist. <!-- Let's try to give a proper length and width to all the standard cell (say rectangular to all), so we are intreseted in the dimesions of the standard cell not the wire for core and die. Lets say the std cell have dimension of 1 uint to 1 unit for each std cell with the help of this we will try to find the area utilised by the cells. So we bring all the cells together ignoring the wires and we can calculate the total area as well as dimensions. Now we have rough idea about the area of our netlist. So now place all the logic cells in the core.so we get the utilization of our core. --> 
2. Core is the section where fundamental logic is being place whereas a die is a small semiconductor material specimen on which the fundamental circuit is fabricated and it consists of core. 
3. Once the logic is placed in the core it utilizes certain amount of core which is characterised by utilization factor (Area occupied by netlist / total area of the core). If utilization factor = 1 it means 100% utilization, hence no extra cells could be added. Therefore in a practical scenario the core utilization factor is always less than 1. Hence we generally go for 50-60% utilization. utilization factor = 0.5-0.6)
4. Another important consideration is aspec ratio ((height)/(width) of the core). If aspect ratio = 1 it means the chip is square in nature. 

### Concept of pre-placed cells

Generally the utilization factor is less than 1, hence we have some un used section of core. These unused section of the core is used for optimization and other things. In the unused section we place additional cells, used for routing, etc. 

Pre-placed cells - It is based on the concept of reusable modules or IP's. These blocks need not be implemented everytime we need to use it, these blocks are functionally implemented sometime in the past i.e., only once (for eg - memory, clock-gating, vomparator, mux,etc). These cells are called pre-placed ceels. It's needed to define the placement of these cells or IP's in a chip before routing. These have fixed places on the chip defined by the user. Since these cells are placed before placement and routing hence these are called Pre-placed cells. The pre-placed cells are being placed on a core depending on the design scenario. Automated placement and routing tools does not touch these cell positions. <!-- These a certain combinational logic (mux, freq divider, etc). These logic does such a big task that is has 100000s of gate. So there is a way by which we need not develop this circuitary everytime but we can take a piece of the circuit and implement it seperatly by dividing the circut. -->

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214826732-7fc3691c-3c26-43a6-9a0e-98c05adcdc15.png)

### De-coupling capacitors

The pre-placed cells needs to be surrounded by De-coupling capacitors.  Whenever there is a switching in a circuit there is amount of current required because basically there is small capacitor present at each node, so (switching from 0 to 1) means the capacitor has to charge to represent logic 1 and the amount of charge is sent from the supply voltage. So, it is responsiblity of the supply voltage to supply the amount of current to the switching logic. Also while 1 to 0 switching it is the responsibility of VSS to take all the charge hence thre is discharge current. Now due to wire resistance, inductance there is a drop in the voltage across the wire during flow of current. There is a drop because these wires are vias hence it has physical dimensions hence it has res, cap, inductance etc. Now due to the drop there is VDD' at the node i.e., instead of 1V (VDD) we have 0.7V (VDD')  The 0.7 V (VDD') should be in our [noise margin range](https://www.electronics-tutorial.net/digital-logic-families/noise-margin/). So, if the VDD` lies in the noise margin range then we are safe but sometimes we can be unsafe. To ensure the safety we use decoupling caps, these are huge caps filled with charge and the equivalent voltage across the caps are same as supply voltage. Hence the required current is provided by this caps. This caps de-couples the circuit from the main supply whenever there is switching. Now we have taken care of local communication. Next we need to focus on global communication.

### Power planning

There a lot of macros on a chip and if each macro has it's current demand so there will be lot of de-coupling capacitor which is not feasible. Therefore, some critical blocks are decoupled using de-coupling cap but not for each element. There is always a posibility of voltage drop at certain node in the circuit. Suppose there is a 16 caps connected in parallel and all are going to switch from logic 1 to logic 0 i.e., caps are discharging and all this connected to same ground. All of these caps discharge at same time then there is a ground bounce (bump at the ground) and if the size of the bump exceeds the noise margin then it might enter into undefined state. Also when all the caps try to charge from 0 to 1 then there is a voltage droop (demanding of power at the same time) and again the noise margin concept applies here too. 
This problem happens only because there is power supply at one point, if there is power supply present in the entire perpherry then this problem is resolved. Hence solution to above problem is multiple power supply and ground. Therefore we have multiple VDD and VSS ports.

### Pin Placement and logical cell placement blockage

The connectivity information betweer the gates is codded using VHDL/Verilog language and is called as the netlist.

There are pre-placed cells already present in the core. The area between the core and die are filled with the input and output ports. The I/O ports placement depends upon the cells connected to these ports as well as the pre-place cells. The clock ports are bigger in size as these are continously driven pins and these drives the complete chip. So we need the least resistance path for the clocks hence clock pins are thickers.

After pin placement it should be made sure that the remaining empty area between the core and the die is blocked. Therefore logical cell placement bloackage is done. Hence it ensures that automated placement and routing does not place anything in this area.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214906520-25443bef-e78a-4edf-9b71-e592b91424c2.png)

**Voila!! we are done with Floor and Power Planning.**

**NOTE: Standard cell placement happens in placement stage.**

### Placement and routing

* Netlist binding and initial place design
1. Lets suppose the shape of the gate determine the functionality of the gate but in reality each gate is a black box. Hence we take each gate and give them a physical dimensions. This is done for each of the component of the netlist. These cells are present in a library which consists the following  information and files shape and size, delays, various flavour of the cells and the timing information. Library akso orvide options with different delay and sizes. Particular cell is chosen as per our requirement.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214969249-20d0f22a-4c0d-4f70-b9f5-392cb42a2c2a.png)

2. Next step is to take the particular shap and sizes and then place it on the floorplan. The pre-placed cells are not disturbed. During placement logical connectivity is maintained as well as the placement is done in such a way that optimized path is formed (i.e., blocks placed close to there input and output) 

3. Till now we have kept o/p port near the output and input port near the input. Now using some estimations we will try to do optimized placement. We can try to estimate the capacitances and resistance b/w two point. The wirelength will form a resistanace which will cause unnecessary voltage drop and a capacitance which will cause a slew rate that might not be permissible for fast current switching of logic gates. Successfully transmitting the signal from one place to another without any loss is known as signal eintegrity. To maintain the signal integrity we require repeaters (kind of buffers) and these are inserted as per the wire length and capacitance and based on these cap and resistance, a waveform is genrated and the transition of the waveform should be in permisible range. But now we have loss of area. Hence where integrity is maintained there we do not place any repeaters but if integrity not maintained the we insert the buffer (repeater). We need to come to a conclusion with minimum number of repeater. Sometime we also do abutment where logic cells are placed very close to each other (almost zero delay) if it has to run at high frequency (2GHz). Crisscrossing of routes is a normal for PnR and it can be avoided by use separate metal layer (using vias) for crisscrossed path.

    Based on ideal condition of the clock (time required by clock to reach a component is 0) we will do setup timing analysis and based on this we will       check our placement condition is meeting the given specification or not.

    Placement in OpenLANE is done in two stages:

* Global Placement - It's main job is to reduce the wire length. It is generally a coarse placement. Here no leaglization happens. Here the concept of **HPWL** (Half Parameter Wirelength) reduction model. 

* Detailed Placement - legalization happens here the std. cells are placed in std cell rows. {legalization - They shoulde be exactly inside the row and the should be abutted on each other and there should be no overlap}.

The main ain of placement now is congestion, it is not the timing analysis.
The next step will be CTS. 

Placement before buffer insertion: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214977372-22400c76-ebfe-4d5f-b4c9-0715352351b0.png)

Placement with buffers

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214977547-4198edb6-b2e9-49d1-888d-4c75422d5aa9.png)

Our objective is to converge the value of Overflow (it is present below HPWL value during run_placement. If the value of overflow decreases our design will converge. Now we can see the generayed .def file in the placement folder under results using the Magic tool.

<!-- Slew is dependented upon the value of cap. The higher the value more is the charge required to charge the cap and the slew will be bad Abutment has lot of advantage STA is done to know maximum achievable frequency-->

**NOTE: ** Collection of gates in an area is called as library. 

## Cell design and characterization flows

In IC design flow a library is a place where we keep all our standard cells, buffers, decap cell, etc. The library does not only have different cells with different functionality but it also have same cell with different sizes, threshold voltage, delays, etc. 

* Examining an inverter

Cell design flow is divided into three parts: `inputs`,`design steps` and `outputs`.
1. Inputs - Inputs to design an inverter is basically the PDKs which consists of DRC & LVS rules, SPICE models, library and user-defined specs.

  - DRC & LVS Rules - These are the technology rules defined by the foundary. tech files and poly subtrate paramters (CUSTOME LAYOUT COURSE)
  
  - SPICE Models - These consists of all the parameters based on the foundary for eg: Threshold voltage, linear regions, saturation region equations with added foundry parameters. Including NMOS and PMOS parameteres (Ciruit Deisgn and Spice simulation Course)
  
  - User defined Spec = These are the specifications given by the user which is to be achieved by following the DRC and LVS rules. Maintaining Cell height (separation between power and ground rail), Cell width (depends on drive strength), supply voltage(provided by top level, keep noise margin in check), metal layer requirement (which metal layer the cell needs to work), pin location, drawn gate length, etc.
  
<!--higher the drive strength lower wire it can drive.-->

Now we have all the inputs with us (available with the library developers). Now the developer should take the input and come up with std cells that adheres to these specs and rules.

2. Design steps - It has three different steps: `circuit design`,`layout design` and `characterisation`.
  - circuit design includes the implentation of the logic and the modeling W/l ratio of NMOS and PMOS.
  - Implementation of the circuit description language (i.e., output of the circuit design) is called layout design. 
 
 ```
  Steps in layout design:
  1. Get the function implemented using CMOS.
  2. Get a PMOS and NMOS network graph out of the implemented circuit. (using Euler's method)
  3. Obtain the Euler's path, it is a path that is traced only once.
  4. Draw the stick diagram.
  5. Convert the stick diagram into layout adhering with the DRC rules given by the foundary. 
  
  The layout is generated using Magic tool .Now we have the cell width and cell height and all the cells adhere to the rules.
 ```
 We can extract the parasitics from the layout and we have characterise it with respect to timing.
 
 3. Outputs - The output of the layout desgn is GDSII. Lef defines the width and height of the cells. It also gives extracted spice netlist. 

Now we will do chararacterisation and we will generate timing, noise, power libs function. Here we will try to understande various syntax and symantic of timing.lib, power.lib and noise.lib. These syntax are important to understand the GUNA software i.e., the characterisation software because software works on these variables and these are the variables present with us in order to feed into the software. 

* Timing charaterisation 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/215085932-a7f32902-9301-41a1-9f64-3a51c48022ef.png)

Here we first understand different threshold point of waveform itself called as timing threshold defination.

Consider the above two inverter figure and understand the graph below. red curve - input to the circuit at 2nd inverter, blue curve - output of the circuit after 2nd inverter. We have slew deniation shown in the figure below for both rising and falling edge. 
With help of all the timing threshold defination we are able to calculate our slew as well as the propagation delay.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/215090838-a064c684-1e07-4b99-8d5c-0b47b19bbdfe.png)

Similarly we have threshold for the delays (rise and fall) as we had for slew hence we analyse the waveform for the delays. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/215091498-c0d76565-9b7b-41fa-9c04-6c20fe0cd85b.png)

Getting a negative propagation delay is highly unexpected. A negative propagation delay means that the output comes before the input. Hence to avoid negative propagation delay we as designer need to choose correct threshold points which eventually leads to positive delays. Propagation delay threshold is usually 50% and slew rate threshold is 20-80%.

### LAB Day 2

Continuation after synthesis.

**Step 1:** Running floorplan
* We have lot of switches with which we adjust the flow directory. These switches are used to set certain parameter in each stage of the flow. For eg: In the Floorplanning stage we have `FP_CORE_UTIL {for utilization percentage}`, `FP_ASPECT_RATIO {sets the aspect ratio}`, `FP_CORE_MARGINS {offset b/w die boundary and core boundary}`, etc. We have certain .tcl file in OpenLane which has these switchs that sets these specifications. 

```

```
 
**floorplan.tcl contains the following default switchs**

* The command to run floorplan is:

``
run_floorplan
``

**Step 2:** Review floorplan files and steps to view floorplan

* Reviewing files

Here basically the ceated files are being checkd using the log files presen in the `log/floorpla/4-ioPlacer.log`. In case it is not there we can check it using the Magic tool.

 - for floorplan the core utilization is 50%
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214932840-71d0969f-196f-4e3f-a163-141fdc0b8174.png)
 - for config.tcl file under the runs folder core utilization is 35%.
    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214932703-7cd63e42-bc32-4ffd-9cfa-4ca511f0e38d.png)
    
 - setting the core utilization, verticle and horizontal metal layer by add these three switchs in the config.tcl file

```
set ::env(FP_CORE_UTIL) 65
set ::env(FP_IO_VMETAL) 4
set ::env(FP_IO_HMETAL) 3
```
    
* Viewing Floorplan

The def (design exchange format) file is created in the floorplan folder of the results folder under runs folder. This file has the information about the die area. This gives the co-ordinates of the die and the unit is databse unit per micron i.e. 1 micron = 1000 database units)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214935860-e584d395-802b-4f7c-9e8e-2e3e3e7efbee.png)

The die co-ordinates and other information can be viewed using following command invoked under the picorv32a folder.

```
cd runs/[date]/results/floorplan/picorv32a.floorplan.def
```

**NOTE: 1 micron is equivalent to 1000 database units**

### TASK 2: Calculating area
**Calculating the die area = (660685 / 1000) x (671405/1000) = 443587.2124 um <sup>2</sup>**

**Step 3:** Review floorplan layout in Magic

* Using Magic tool to view the def file 

The following command can be used to invoke magic tool as well as open the def file:

```
magic -T /home/nickson/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.floorplan.def &f
```

To center the view, press "s" to select whole die then press "v" to center the view. Point the cursor to a cell then press "s" to select it, zoom into it by pressing 'z". Type "what" in `tkcon` to display information of selected object. These objects might be IO pin, decap cell, or well taps as shown below.

The genrated file is shown below: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214947957-92a584f1-e87d-4fcb-a176-dd2f0b992401.png)

The horizontal and verticle pins:

The decap cells:

The diagonally equidistant tapcells: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214965422-0c9ffde3-c770-4f84-b8d8-5c0c3af134ba.png)

The standard cells in the bottom left corner:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69652104/214965088-1ae98625-9e9c-4936-a235-017b543f6704.png)

**Step 4:** Running Placement

The following command is used to run placement.

```
run_placement
```

During place a number of tools such as RePlace tool (for global placement), Resier tool (for optimization) and OpenDP (for detailed placement) is invoked. If the value of overflow converges then the design is legal.

* Using Magic tool to see the layout of this stage.

```
magic -T /home/nickson/Desktop/work/tools/openlane_working_dir/pdks/sky130A/libs.tech/magic/sky130A.tech lef read ../../tmp/merged.lef def read picorv32a.placement.def &
```

The genrated layout:

Placement ensures that the standard cells are correctly placed. 
PDN is created during floorplan. But is Openlane there is a post floorplan, post placement and CTS is done for PDN.

# Day 3 - Design library cell using Magic Layout and ngspice characterization

## LAB Day 3

## Labs for CMOS inverter ngspice simulations
Here we will be dive deep into the flow. We will take a .mag file and do post-layout simulation in ngspice. After post-characterising we will be plugging this cell into the openlane flow i.e., into picorv32a core. 

* IO Placer revision
Earlier we had equidistant placed input/output pins.
